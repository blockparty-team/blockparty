    Distortion started as an experimental party project in 1998. In 2000 it
    became a 5-day-long party-crawl going through one Copenhagen district per
    day. The magic started with plenty of intimate backyard grill parties,
    receptions, happenings, party bus and champagne boats, all over Copenhagen,
    with 30-200 people at each get-together. Each event was cute, but it was the
    combination and the fact that Distortion was a travel through the city, full
    of genuine love for Copenhagen, that created the special atmosphere. Many of
    these events were not totally legal, but we were always semi-responsible: we
    cleaned after ourselves and respected the neighbours. The Police was nice
    when we met them – and since we were mobile and happy, we just moved around
    and no problemo.

    For the first time in 2007, we got 1,500 guests at one single street party
    on Enghave Plads and almost 3,000 guests at Final Party. Until then, we had
    never had a strategy or a budget: Distortion was just for fun. In 2008, we
    opened a semi-professional entrepreneurship (the Distortion secretariat,
    Nus/Nus) made a contract with the Copenhagen City Council and bought a
    trashy black 1982-Mercedes stretch limousine – and somehow relaunched the
    festival. Things have gone fast since then. In 2011 we broke into the
    mainstream with 100.000+ guests at Vesterbro’s block party. In 2012 we
    became a not-for-profit Foundation and in 2013, we were finally ready to
    soon be known around the world as the craziest party on the planet.
